Each tile looks something like this..\nIf the agent, frame, and point form a record, then the structure and map make up the record player. Living as a human agent on Earth grounds us in music that can tile into a mosaic of selves to be explored and understood as a unitary self.\nTiles can be differentiated through two different transformations on the basic template above. The first transformation is of the record, and the second transformation is of the record player. Leaving the record player alone allows for variation to be encoded into agent and frame curves bounded by the map. Leaving the record alone allows for a variable number of map and structure edges. The first transformation favors computability and the second favors countability.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/volution/docs/agent/cognition/","title":"Cognition","section":"Agent","content":"cognition #  Cognition explores what makes an agent tick. Like analog clocks, agents can target paths that connect inner fits to outter fits through actuation. The pendulum of a clock swings at an internal frequency which can be compared to an external frequency like the revolution of the earth around the sun.\nBoth the spotlight and holographic models of consciousness appear to have partial truth. The spotlight being associated with focused attention and the hologram with diffuse attention across a field. Agents can both peer into the narrowest scope and meditate upon the vastest horizons.\ntopology #  No cutting or gluing is allowed in topology. So topological distictions may be used to identify various tile states. Gluing together every layer of the record player produces a state called actuation. Fits glue maps to structures in the case of an external fit and frames to points in the case of internal fits.\nactuator #  Actuation glues external and internal fits to the agent. This aligns with a state of flow. In the mist of an activity that is engaging yet smooth for you, it may feel as if time is flowing quickly. In volution, actuation or flow is considered a state where everything is connected topologically indicating an alignment between what the agent considers out and in.\nfit #  Fits come in two flavors: in and out. Internal fits, or point-frame combinations, signify intuition, feeling, eureka, inspiration, depression, and so forth. External fits, or structure-map combinations, signify sensation, thought, experience, reward, punishment, and so forth. Another way to cut the distinction is through the dichotomy between denotation and connotation. As the outside can be labelled through finger pointing, though the inside can only be referenced in light while shadows hide roots below the surface.\ngeometry #  spotlight #  hologram #  "},{"id":2,"href":"/volution/docs/agent/type/","title":"Type","section":"Agent","content":"type #  punctures #  Punctures are a vanishingly small perturbations of consciousness directed on one of eight paths.

Causation unites an internal fit with an external fit so that a linear map forms the ground of a structural tree growing bi-directionally. Each continuous unit of distance in the positive or negative directions can correlate with any other unit of continuity.\nOne useful measure being time, where the internal fit can approach the past by moving left and the future by moving right. The futher an agent moves in the past/future, the hazier the view becomes.
