Each tile looks something like this..\nIf the agent, frame, and point form a record, then the structure and map make up the record player. Living as a human agent on Earth grounds us in music that can tile into a mosaic of selves to be explored and understood as a unitary self.\nTiles can be differentiated through two different transformations on the basic template above. The first transformation is of the record, and the second transformation is of the record player. Leaving the record player alone allows for variation to be encoded into agent and frame curves bounded by the map. Leaving the record alone allows for a variable number of map and structure edges. The first transformation favors computability and the second favors countability.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/volution/docs/ground/","title":"Ground","section":"Docs","content":"Ground #  The Ground branch is conscerned with agents on Earth. On Earth, agents are simultainously constrained and enabled by movement. Movement not just in space and time but along any path of discernible continuity.\n"}]
